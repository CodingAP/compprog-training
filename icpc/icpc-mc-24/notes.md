Note: None of the notes are from official sources, most come from me researching and implementing the problems to confirm if they work or not.

Below is the command to run each problem, with X being the sample input/output set

```bash
cd <problem>
g++ main.cpp -o main && ./main < inputX.txt > outputX.txt
```
